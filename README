Net::DHCP::Watch - A class for monitoring a remote DHCP server.

Net::DHCP::Watch is a module to help monitor REMOTE DHCP servers. It
opens an udp socket to send and receive responses to and from a DHCP
server. It stores the last connection status information.

At the time of this writing, the DHCP protocol has not implemented yet a
failover protocol (it is in proposal stage). This module helps to write 
some simple code to implement this feature.

For an example of use, see the examples directory in the distribution.
