Net::DHCP::Watch - A class for monitoring a remote DHCP server.

Net::DHCP::Watch is a module to help monitor REMOTE DHCP servers. It
opens an udp socket to send and receive responses to and from a DHCP
server. It stores the last connection status information.

At the time of this writing, the DHCP protocol has not defined yet a
failover protocol. This module was written to help to write some
simple code to implement this feature.

For an example of use, see the examples directory in the distribution.
